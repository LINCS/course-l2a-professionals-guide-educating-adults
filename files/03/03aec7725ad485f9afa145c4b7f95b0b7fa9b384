               <title>Introduction</title>
               <cctext>The Professional Guide is a companion piece for the Learning to Achieve training. However, it was also developed to be a useful resource for educators to better understand learning disabilities of adults. The Professional Guide explains the characteristics of adults with learning disabilities and provides intervention strategies for teaching these students. Because the intervention strategies in the guide are relevant to any individual with learning disabilities, practitioners can use the guide for a large spectrum of students.

               <title>Definition and Legal Issues</title>
               <cctext>Chapter one of the Professional Guide defines common learning disabilities and explores the legal issues surrounding them. It is important for educators to better understand learning disabilities and how, as educators, they can aid adult students in the learning process. Educators should also be aware of the legal requirements for students and educational facilities. </cctext>

               <title>Definition and Legal Issues</title>
               <cctext>Learning disabilities can affect anyone in any ethnic, cultural, or economic group. They may occur in conjunction with other disabilities, but learning disabilities are not caused by other conditions. Students with learning disabilities usually perform well in all other areas. A student who performs well in math may have issues producing written compositions. Students who are able to speak eloquently may have issues with reading or writing.
Yet, learning disabilities are difficult to define. As understandings and knowledge of learning disabilities are developed, definitions are expanded. Professionals in the field agree upon a set of specific characteristics that can be used to define learning disabilities. See the Professional Guide for more details on these characteristics.

               <title>Definition and Legal Issues</title>
               <cctext>Individuals with learning disabilities have legal rights, including confidentiality. There are three laws that specifically deal with learning disabilities.
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA, addresses the needs of children with identified disabilities from an early age up to age 21. This act provides free educational opportunities and accommodations for students with learning disabilities. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects individuals from discrimination in both work-related and educational environments. Employers and educators must abide by the stipulations of this law. This includes providing appropriate reasonable accommodations for people with learning disabilities. And finally, the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, or ADAAA, is based on the Rehab Act of 1973. However, the ADAAA encompasses a broader range of situations than the Rehab Act.

               <title>Self-Determination</title>
               <cctext>Chapter two of the Professional Guide explores the elements of self-determination. Simply stated, self-determination is the development of the personal characteristics, knowledge, and skills needed to take responsibility and control for one’s actions. It is related to positive outcomes in people’s lives and can be taught in a classroom. It should be incorporated into adult education programs and, in many cases, may be taught before essential reading and writing strategies.

               <title>Self-Determination</title>
               <cctext>The foundations of self-determination are gaining self-awareness and learning to value oneself. Self-awareness allows individuals to know their needs and preferences as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Awareness of one’s options and acknowledging what points are critical to the individual are also essential. As a teacher, you can help students gain self-awareness by incorporating activities that ask them to identify their strengths as well as their preferences and needs. Individuals who value themselves accept themselves for who they are and appreciate their individual abilities. They identify positive and negative elements in their lives. Teachers can help students learn to value themselves by using examples of well-known individuals who have overcome challenges. For example Michael Jordon was cut from his high school basketball team. Many people would have let that stop them from pursuing basketball. But he still became a professional basketball player. Once individuals have gained this foundation, they can grow the skills they need to be self-determined individuals. Self-determined individuals set long-and short-term goals and outline steps for accomplishing those goals. Teachers may use activities that help students learn to plan by giving them an assignment in which they must develop a plan and timeline to complete it. Being proactive is also an important aspect of self-determination. Proactive individuals take risks as appropriate and use effective communication skills to gain support and build relationships. Students benefit from role-playing activities that encourage them to use different communication skills. The last essential skill of self-determined individuals is the ability to reflect and readjust. Individuals must be able to evaluate a situation’s actual outcome and compare it to the expected outcome. They learn from their mistakes and recognize what may need to be adjusted to achieve the desired outcome next time. In order for students to identify barriers that are blocking them from achieving success, teachers can provide models to help them succeed. This may include problem-solving models or self-monitoring. It is important for students to be in an environment that fosters self-determination. Teachers should make sure the classroom structure allows students to learn about their strengths and needs to optimize learning. Teachers should also provide clear objectives and demonstrate the steps to completing tasks.

               <title>Explicit Instruction for Strategy Learning</title>
               <cctext>Students with learning disabilities benefit from a more structured approach to instruction. Explicit instruction means that the teacher clearly defines the learning process and follows a sequence of teaching procedures. For example, a teacher will provide learners with positive and constructive feedback after the learners have tried practicing a new skill. This can be done in either a group or individual setting. The strategies focus on teaching students how to think rather than engaging them in rote learning. Explicit strategy instruction is especially effective with students with learning disabilities because many of these students have issues processing information. This instruction will help students transition from being dependent learners to independent learners.

               <title>Explicit Instruction for Strategy Learning</title>
               <cctext>Explicit Strategy Instruction includes four main components.
Providing clear explanations is the first component. Students need to be introduced to the learning task and the necessary skills to complete the task. Teachers need to make sure students have notes about the skill, that the rationale is discussed, and learner-friendly language is used. The strategy should also be connected to previous learning activities.
Next the students will observe the teacher modeling the task and using the skills to complete the task. It is important that the teacher think aloud to help students understand the thinking process. In the third component, the teacher and students will complete a learning task together. The teacher should guide the students, provide feedback, and check on their understanding and use of the skills. The last step allows students to practice the skills and complete the task independently. It is important during every step to provide immediate, positive, and corrective feedback. See the Professional Guide for examples of modeling and lesson planning.

               <title>Reading Disabilities</title>
               <cctext>There are three main types of reading disability profiles. They include word recognition and spelling; fluency and automaticity; and language comprehension.

               <title>Reading Disabilities</title>
               <cctext>Students who struggle with the ability to listen to language and detect individual sounds have a disability related to word recognition and spelling. 
Disabilities in fluency and automaticity profiles are marked by inaccurate, slow, and expressionless reading. 
Language comprehension profiles address students with verbal memory limitations.
These can occur individually or in combination with each other. Various factors may contribute to reading disabilities, but the main contributor is often phonological processing.

               <title>Reading Disabilities</title>
               <cctext>Adults with reading disabilities need specific reading instruction in the five components of reading comprehension. The five skills are divided into two categories, Print Skills and Meaning Skills. The essential print skills are phonemic awareness, decoding, and fluency. The essential meaning skills are vocabulary and comprehension strategies.
Click on each skill to learn more.
When all of these skills are explicitly taught and utilized, readers are able to gain full comprehension of concepts and ideas.
Phonemic Awareness 
Phonemic awareness concerns the ability to detect individual speech sounds in words. It is the most common area of deficit for adult learners. Instruction for phonemic awareness should provide a clear rationale to allow the learner to understand the need to work at this basic level. Materials should be adapted to the needs of adults.
Decoding 
Decoding is the ability to match written letters to the sounds they represent in words. Instruction should be systematic. It should engage students in a variety of reading activities that lead to automatic word recognition.
Fluency 
Reading fluency is the ability to read passages accurately, rapidly, with expression, and with little effort. Instruction may include previewing, repeated readings, and corrective feedback during oral reading.
Vocabulary 
Vocabulary is the understanding of word meanings based on how words are formed and used. Instruction should include vocabulary learning strategies and opportunities for verbal interactions such as group work. Students should also be encouraged to think about words in new ways using strategies such as word mapping.
Comprehension Strategies
Comprehension strategies are used to help students gain the ability to effectively derive meaning from reading a text. Instruction may include multiple strategies that are used before, during, and after reading.

               <title>Written Expression Disabilities</title>
               <cctext>Writing is used in daily routines from the workplace to compiling a grocery list. However, many adults struggle when asked to write. Writing problems may be linked to reading disabilities, but a good reader may be a poor writer. Therefore it is important to identify the specific area of deficit. Adults with written expression disabilities need specific instruction in one or both areas of transcription and generation. The instruction discussed in this chapter is also helpful in GED preparation courses.

               <title>Written Expression Disabilities</title>
               <cctext>Transcription is the production of letters and spelling in written products. If a student’s handwriting is difficult to read, it may be caused by an underlying neurological condition called dysgraphia. Indicators of this condition include poor letter formation, inconsistent letter size and spacing between letters, crowded and cramped letters, and lack of fluency in writing. Instruction for handwriting should address fluency and legibility. Students with learning disabilities often have problems with spelling. It is a symptom of underlying issues with phonemic awareness. Spelling instruction should help individuals develop proficiency and fluency by focusing on regular spelling patterns, frequently used words, spelling study/practice strategies, and proofing skills. Generation is the other area of focus for adults with written expression disabilities. Generation is the production of written compositions. In order for someone to clearly communicate in a written composition, they must have the proper skills to generate it. Production requires planning, organizing, drafting, and revising skills. In order to write effective compositions, students must have content knowledge of the topic, use syntax, and apply writing strategies. Instruction for generating written compositions should include Self-Regulated Strategy Development, also known as SRSD. SRSD uses explicit instruction tailored for specific types of compositions to allow students to work at their own level. See the Professional Guide for examples of SRSD.

               <title>Content Learning</title>
               <cctext>Content learning is the process of constructing and organizing information in order for an individual to think, talk, speak, write, or communicate effectively. Adults with learning disabilities struggle with content learning because their learning disabilities place limitations on their abilities to process information. Explicit instruction for content learning can be incorporated into the classroom and may include teacher- or student-focused strategies.

               <title>Content Learning</title>
               <cctext>There are seven critical teacher-focused strategies. They include selection of important content, content enhancement, information presentation, ways to engage learners, graphic organizers, use of technology, and the use of elaboration to extend a learner’s understanding. Student-focused strategies develop the student’s ability to independently use strategies to learn content. Examples of strategies that students might use are summarizing and making inferences. Click on each strategy to learn more.  
			   
Selection of Important Content
There is an abundance of information to be taught. Effective instruction will include all necessary information, but it will not overload the student. There are multiple resources available to determine necessary content for adult education including the Equipped for the Future (EFF) standards. 

Content Enhancement
Once the necessary information to be taught has been determined, the central ideas, key concepts, and vocabulary must be identified. Learning must be structured in a way that helps students organize and comprehend information. A number of content-enhancement routines can be applied to instruction. See the Professional Guide for specific examples.

Information Presentation
A critical part of content instruction is the use of external materials to help students visualize the content. It is also important to note that information presented orally should be accompanied by visuals that further explain the ideas being discussed.

Ways to Engage Learners
In order to engage students, information must be translated into a format that learners can understand.  Then a teacher must identify how students will engage with the content and decide if comprehension strategy instruction is also needed. Teachers must use components of explicit instruction such as modeling and guided practice. All of these factors combined together will help engage learners.

Graphic Organizers
Graphic organizers can be used by teachers and students alike. Teachers may prepare them in advance to present information to students. Students may fill out graphic organizers to help them understand information. They are useful tools that have been proven to be effective for students with learning disabilities.

Use of Technology
Technology can play two roles in instruction for adults with learning disabilities. It may provide access for reading deficits, such as the use of text-to-speech software. Or technology may support learning by providing an opportunity for research-based projects that facilitate higher-order thinking. Most approaches for using technology for access fall under Universal Design for Learning (UDL). UDL calls for flexibility in instruction, engagement, and presentation, which often require technology.

Elaboration
Elaboration allows learners to extend an idea while maintaining its original meaning. Students benefit from this strategy because it requires them to think about information in a new way. Elaboration may include paraphrasing, comparing and contrasting ideas, or even role playing.

Summarizing
The ability to summarize information is an essential skill. It requires the ability to identify the important concepts and ideas and present them clearly and succinctly. See the Professional Guide for an example of instruction on summarizing.

Making Inferences
The ability to read a text and think beyond the literal information is crucial in developing higher-order thinking skills. Inferring means a reader finds clues to connect to background knowledge. This allows a reader to draw conclusions about a text. A teacher may use “think aloud” models to infer meaning. Read the following examples of ways to infer meanings using “think aloud” models.
